# first-website
This website is my first website. It is based on a simple journal I created using python. This journal allows the admin to add journals and write entries. The user can sort the entries into certain notebooks. For example, the user can create a notebook for each subject and take notes related to that subject. These notes can be sorted into the desired notebook. I used Python and HTML to create this project.
